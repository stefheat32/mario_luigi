PROJECT PLAN

CLIENT:
Mr.Panucci

TEAM:
The Alligators
Stefano Schiavone: 558150@student.fontys.nl

CURRENT SITUATION:
The restaurant operates in an inefficient way:
   - Mario takes an order from a customer
   - Mario shouts the order to the kitchen
   - Luigi attempts to hear what is being shouted and writes it down on his notepad
   - Luigi bakes the pizza in the oven
   - Luigi shouts to Mario when the pizza is ready
   - Mario picks up the pizza and brings it to the customer if he hears Luigi

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
Customers are often uncomfortable with the methods of communication that Mario and Luigi use. Additionally Luigi sometimes makes the wrong pizzas due to
the poor communication and this causes a waste of resources (time, ingredients, energy, etc)

PROJECT GOAL:
Increase profit, more customer traction, less waste of resources and higher customer satisfaction.
